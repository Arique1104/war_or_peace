# Create 52 Cards (A standard deck)
standard_deck = StandardDeck.new
# Put those card into two Decks (some randomness would be nice here!)

# Create two players with the Decks you created

# Start the game using a new method called start
# This method will need to be included in a class - it is up to you which class to include it in - either existing or ✨new ✨
